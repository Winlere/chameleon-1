# n: Number of columns of the matrix B and order of the matrix A if side = ChamRight
# lda: Leading dimension of matrix A
# ldb: Leading dimension of matrix B
# uplo: Matrix part to be considered (0: Upper, 1: Lower)
# side: Whether A appears on the left or on the right of B
# trans: Whether the matrix A is transposed or conjugate transposed
# diag: Whether or not A is unit triangular
# alpha: Scalar alpha
